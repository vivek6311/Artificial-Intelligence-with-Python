        "Welcome to the Lab 2 of our course on Natural Language Processing. As the name suggests in this lab you will learn how to fine-tune a pretrained model like BERT on a downstream task to improve much more superior performance compared to the methods discussed so far. We will be working with the [SocialIQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09728) dataset this week, which is a multiple choice classification dataset designed to learn and measure social and emotional intelligence in NLP models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment will also make heavy use of the [🤗 Transformers Library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index). Don't worry if you are not familiar with the library, we will discuss its usage in detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Access to a GPU will be crucial for working on this assignment. So do select a GPU runtime in Colab before you start working.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning Outcomes from this Lab:\n",
        "- Learn how to use 🤗 Transformer library to load and fine-tune pre-trained langauge models\n",
        "- Learn how to solve common sense reasoning problems using Masked Language Models like BERT\n",

It is a multiple choice classification task, where you are given a context of some social situation, a question about the context and then three possible answers to the questions. The task is to predict which of the three options answers the question given the context.\n",

Also, notice the model contains 12 BERT layers, where each layer consists of a Self Attention layer followed by a sequence of linear layers and activation functions (MLP), as we discussed when talking about Transformer architecture in the lecture."

At the backbone we have the BERT model, using which we obtain the contextualized representation of the [context, question, answer] sequence. We then use the \\[CLS\\] token's embedding as the sequence representation and feed it to a 2 layer MLP (Linear(768, 768) -> ReLU -> Linear(768, 1)) that scores the answer. To predict the correct answer, score each of the three answers, obtain their scores and normalize them by applying softmax, that gives us the probability of each option being the correct answer.\n",
